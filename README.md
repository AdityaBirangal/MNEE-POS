## Overview

MNEE POS enables merchants to:
- Create invoices with custom amounts
- Generate payment URLs and QR codes
- Accept MNEE stablecoin payments via x402 protocol
- Track payment status in real-time

The application uses **Thirdweb's x402 SDK** for payment processing, which handles:
- ERC4337 UserOperation batching (gasless transactions)
- Payment signature verification
- Automatic payment settlement

**MNEE** is a USD-backed stablecoin live on Ethereum, designed for programmable money applications in commerce, AI automation, and financial coordination.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Payment Protocol**: x402 HTTP 402 (via Thirdweb SDK v5)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Mainnet
- **Token**: MNEE (18 decimals, contract: `0x8ccedbAe4916b79da7F3F612EfB2EB93A2bFD6cF`)
- **Wallet Integration**: Thirdweb React SDK
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma)

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

**MNEE Token Contract Limitation:**

The MNEE token contract ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8ccedbae4916b79da7f3f612efb2eb93a2bfd6cf)) does **NOT** support:
- ERC-2612 `permit()` function
- ERC-3009 `transferWithAuthorization()` function

This means **gasless payments via x402 are currently NOT possible** with MNEE. The x402 payment requirements are generated correctly, but payment settlement fails because the token contract lacks the required functions for gasless transactions.

**For Hackathon Submission:**
- ✅ x402 integration is fully implemented and working
- ✅ Payment requirements are generated correctly
- ✅ The limitation is a token contract issue, not an implementation issue
- 📋 This demonstrates the x402 protocol integration, even if full settlement requires token contract upgrades

**Future Enhancement:**
For full x402 compatibility, MNEE would need to implement ERC-2612 (Permit) or ERC-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization) in the token contract.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Thirdweb account (for Client ID and Secret Key)
- Ethereum mainnet wallet with MNEE for testing
- Facilitator wallet (ERC4337 Smart Account) with ETH for gas

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaBirangal/MNEE-POS
cd MNEE-POS
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```env
# Thirdweb Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Facilitator Wallet (ERC4337 Smart Account address)
THIRDWEB_SERVER_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...

# API Base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
